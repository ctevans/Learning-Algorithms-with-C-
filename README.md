## Learning-Algorithms-with-CSHARP
Using C# as the language, I am going to make a grid-world and have a bunch of learning algorithms implemented! 


## So what is this exactly?
I wanted to have a program where I could test to my heart's content all of the learning algorithms I have learned.
A few examples are Expected SARSA, Q-Learning, Double Q-Learning, TD(0), Monte Carlo methods, Dynamic programming, TD(lambda),
and a bunch more! 

Further, I wanted to get experience implementing these algorithms successfully in a programming language I wanted to get
more experience in, I already have done a fair bit of work with C# but it's nice to always expand and try out new things!

## It is a work in progress...
I realize that it lacks a lot of functionality, but I plan to make consistent updates to this! I really love
artificial intellience and machine learning and plan to poke more at it! 

## "What can I do with this?"
Well, now I am glad you asked!

I have created a "map" (think like old 2d style gameboy games!) and I wanted to teach my agent (the program that conducts 
the learning algorithms) to quickly get to the goal state. I have plans to make it so that the map can be modified 
by the user (currently that requires me adding just a few more parameters to the model of the map!).

With more learning algorithms implemented I think it would be very interesting to put them against eachother to see a host
of statistics such as time to obtain an optimal policy! 

*Spoilers(In the future I think it would be cool to expand this to make an AI-based Final Fantasy Tactics like game!)
I mean, having two AI's battle it out in a world I created from the ground up sounds hilarious and fun!
